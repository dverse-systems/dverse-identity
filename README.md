# dverse-identity

`dverse-identity` is a core module of the D-Verse framework responsible for managing decentralized identities (DIDs).

It provides functionalities for:

- Generating cryptographic key pairs (Ed25519).
- Signing and verifying data.
- Deriving `did:dverse` identifiers from public keys.

This module is designed to be a foundational building block for self-sovereign identity within the D-Verse ecosystem.
